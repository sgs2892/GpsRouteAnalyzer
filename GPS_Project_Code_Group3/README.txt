There are 3 ways in which source gps file names can be provided.
    1-> Comma separated values. Pass all the file names separated by a comma
    eg. python3 GPS_Project_Group3.py file1,file2,file3

    2-> File names separated by a space between them
    eg. python3 GPS_Project_Group3.py file1 file2 file2

    3-> If no names are provided, default files are considered.
